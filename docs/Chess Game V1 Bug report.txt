Bug Report


* When either king is in check, game sometimes recognizes a non attacking pawn movement as a threat and won’t allow the king to choose that space as a potential move
* If a piece is actively moving and another piece is quickly tried to move, the model of the second piece will not move, but the position coded in the board will change
* Promote function does not work in network play
* After exiting a network game, problems occur when trying to join a new game
* During network game, Check moves are still considered, but the board will highlight all moves on board even ones that would cause check, but you can’t select them as movements
* Pause menu can be opened when promote window is open
* Selecting and deselecting a piece too quickly can sometimes cause highlights for the piece’s movements to not appear on the board, but the movements are still possible
* Check does not work on AI because implementation caused the game to be unplayably slow against the AI with check in place
